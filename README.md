# Demo app with Angular 5 + Angular CLI + Angular Material + Angular Example Library + ng-Apimock + protractor-image-comparison

## Intro
This project will be used during the workshop [*TESTING BEYOND THE DEFAULT CLICK-PATHS*](https://romaniatesting.ro/sessions/testing-beyond-the-default-click-paths/) on the 11th of May 2018 in  Cluj-Napoca, Romania during the Romanian Testing Conference 2018.

The workshop will be given by [Wim Selles](https://romaniatesting.ro/speakers/wim-selles/) ([wswebcreation](https://github.com/wswebcreation/)) and [Mischa Dasberg](https://romaniatesting.ro/speakers/mischa-dasberg/) ([mdasberg](https://github.com/mdasberg))

We forked this project from [angular5-example-app](https://github.com/Ismaestro/angular5-example-app), made by [Ismael Ramos](https://github.com/Ismaestro) and adjusted it to our needs.

## Usage
