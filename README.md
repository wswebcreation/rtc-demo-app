## Usage

### Preparation of the workshop
**Warning: we strongly recommend node >=v6.9.0 and npm >=3.0.0**

- `git clone https://github.com/wswebcreation/rtc-demo-app.git`
- `cd rtc-demo-app` to go into the demo folder
- `npm i` - Installs everything needed
- `npm start` - Starts the app. Then, go to `localhost:4200`
- `npm run start.mocking` - Starts the mocking. Then, go to `localhost:3000/mocking`
- go to `http://localhost:4300/` to open the demo app
- go to `http://localhost:3000/mocking/` to open the mocking interface

> **Windows: use precompilation to speed up**

    `tsc --project tsconfig.json`
    `npm start`

### Testing with protractor
For running the protractor tests a selenium server needs to be started. The server will automatically be downloaded and updated after install.
If this doesn't work run `npm run webdriver.update` after install.

To run the tests the the following needs to be started:
- the app, see `npm start`
- the mocking server, see `npm run start.mocking`
- the selenium server. Run `npm run webdriver.start`
- and run the tests, use `npm run e2e`, see [protractor.conf.js](./e2e/config/protractor.conf.js) how to provide specific features / tags
